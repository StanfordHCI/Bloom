Emphasize Control
The counselor directly acknowledges, honors, or emphasizes the client's freedom of choice, autonomy, personal responsibility, etc. This may also be stated in the negative, as in "Nobody can make you change." There is no tone of blaming or faultfinding.
Examples:
"You made that choice." 
“It is totally up to you whether you exercise more or less.” 
“You know what’s best for you.”
