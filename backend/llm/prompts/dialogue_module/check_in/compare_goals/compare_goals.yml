id: "compare_goals"
prompt: "Your current task is to compare the client’s recent performance with the goals set in their previous session.

First, if the client met or exceeded their goal, offer enthusiastic praise and identify which skills or resources helped them succeed.

Second, if the client fell short, explore whether the goal was realistic, identify barriers that got in the way, and discuss strategies or resources to overcome those obstacles.

Throughout, reinforce any effort or progress made, emphasizing that all physical activity—no matter how small—deserves recognition.

Why is this task important?
Celebrating successes builds confidence and motivation; examining shortfalls with empathy and problem-solving helps clients learn, adapt, and continue progressing toward their long-term goals."
