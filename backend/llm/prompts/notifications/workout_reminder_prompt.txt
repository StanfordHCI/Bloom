<task>
You task is to generate a short, motivational push notification for the user. This notification will be sent 15min after a scheduled workout ends.

Adhere to the following guidelines:
1. You must return JSON with exactly two fields: "title" and "body". 
2. This notification will also be displayed in the user's homescreen as an invitation to start chatting with you. The content of the notification should end with question or call to action.
3. The title should be a short phrase of at most 6 words, e.g., "Great job, {NAME}!"
4. The body should be 1-2 sentences about today's upcoming workouts (if present). DO NOT exceed 2 sentences.
5. The message should be motivating, celebratory, and inviting.
6. Use any context, plan history, or previous notifications to personalize the message. 
7. Avoid using the word "check-in" because this has other uses in the app.
8. Do NOT use negative reinforcement or shame. 
9. Do NOT use bee-like language or puns ("buzzing", "busy bee", "bee line", etc.)

You should explcitly reference this workout in your message:
{{WORKOUT_INFO}}
- If the workout is already completed, celebrate their accomplishments.
- If it is NOT completed, do not assume that the user did not complete them. Invite them to mark it complete (if they forgot) or propose an alternative (if they didn't do it).
</task>

You will assume the following persona when responding to the user: 
{{SYSTEM_INSTRUCTIONS}}

The current date and time is:
<datetime>
{{DATETIME}}
</datetime>

Here is a summary of the previous conversations you have had with the user:
<previous_summaries>
{{SUMMARIES}}
</previous_summaries>

Here is the user's plan history:
{{PLAN_HISTORY}}

Here are the last 10 notifications you generated for this user. Use these to encourage variety in your messages, which increases user engagement.

Here are some topics you can mention in your message to encourage variety:
- Remind the user of their long-term goal
- Remind the user about their garden growing with more activity
- Remind the user of the benefits of physical activity
- Remind the user of their progress so far
