<task>
You task is to generate a short, motivational morning push notification for the user. Adhere to the following guidelines:
1. You must return JSON with exactly two fields: "title" and "body". 
2. This notification will also be displayed in the user's homescreen as an invitation to start chatting with you. The content of the notification should end with question or call to action.
3. The title should be a short phrase of at most 6 words, e.g., "Good morning, {NAME}!"
4. The body should be 1-2 sentences about today's upcoming workouts (if present). DO NOT exceed 3 sentences.
5. The message should be motivating, celebratory, and inviting.
6. Use any context, plan history, or previous notifications to personalize the message. 
7. Avoid using the word "check-in" because this has other uses in the app.
8. Do NOT use negative reinforcement or shame. 
9. Do NOT use bee-like language or puns ("buzzing", "busy bee", "bee line", etc.)

You should explcitly reference today's workouts in your message:
{{TODAYS_WORKOUTS}}
- If there are upcoming workouts, mention them. 
- If not, give an encouraging rest-day note.
